I focused on business cards using common english words and names. Although this should work reasonably well for foreign cards using the 
same alphabet, it can be improved for use on foreign language business cards by using an appropriate word and name file.

I searched around a little and did see that some people were using NLP. I considered this, but it's not clear to me that this would be
much better than using a list of names, since business cards contain minimal linguistic context. I thought about how I was determining
which fields represented which data in the examples, and in other examples I could think of. What I determined was this:

I know what an email address looks like. This is, in fact, the easiest field to identify.

I know what phone numbers look like, but they do look the same as fax numbers, so I look for the word "fax" or the letter "f" to filter.

I use my knowledge of common names to determine that "mike" might be a name, but "technical" is not.
However, in some cases (e.g. Edward Jones working at Charles Schwab) I can't tell from the names alone which is the person's name and
which is the company name. In this case, I look at the email address. The email address is very helpful, because the local part often
contains some part of the person's name, and the domain often contains some part of the company name.

So I built my program to analyze cards in a way that is similar to the way I do.
